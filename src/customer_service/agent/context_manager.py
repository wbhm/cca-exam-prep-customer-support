"""Structured context management for CCA Customer Support agent.

CCA Rule (OPTIM-02): Use structured JSON summaries, NOT raw transcripts.

Raw transcripts cause:
- O(n) token growth per turn (unbounded)
- Lost-in-middle effect (critical early facts get buried)
- Attention dilution (model focuses on recent content)

ContextSummary prevents these by:
- Fixed-field schema (customer_id, issue_type, etc. never get compacted)
- Budget enforcement (token_estimate <= TOKEN_BUDGET after any number of updates)
- Automatic compaction (truncates decisions_made when budget is exceeded)

CCA Pitfall 5 (documented, not fixed):
    Direct field assignment (e.g., summary.customer_id = "C001") does NOT
    trigger _update_token_estimate(). The token_estimate stays stale until
    update() is called. This is intentional — notebooks use this to demonstrate
    the pitfall to students.
"""

# TOKEN_BUDGET: maximum token_estimate allowed before compaction fires.
# It is compared against token_estimate, which is len(text) // 4, so the budget
# is ~300 tokens (~1,200 characters) of rendered context. Small enough to sit in
# a system block without eating into the prompt cache savings.
